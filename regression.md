# Regression Basics Python

## Requirements

pip install numpy

pip install scipy

pip install scikit-learn

pip install matplotlib

pip install pandas

Along with those tutorial-wide imports, we're also going to be making use of Quandl here:

pip install quandl
I will note again in the first part of the code, but the Quandl module used to be imported with an upper-case Q, but is now imported with a lower-cased q. In the video and sample codes, it is upper-cased.

To begin, what is regression in terms of us using it with machine learning? The goal is to take continuous data, find the equation that best fits the data, and be able forecast out a specific value. With simple linear regression, you are just simply doing this by creating a best fit line:
